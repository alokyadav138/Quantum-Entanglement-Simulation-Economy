# Quantum Entanglement Simulation Economy

## Project Description

The Quantum Entanglement Simulation Economy is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that simulates quantum mechanical phenomena, specifically quantum entanglement, within a decentralized economic framework. This project bridges the gap between quantum physics concepts and blockchain technology, creating an interactive environment where users can create, entangle, and measure quantum particles while earning rewards through a novel tokenomics system.

The platform allows users to mint quantum particles in superposition states, entangle them with other particles across the network, and observe the fascinating quantum mechanical behavior where measuring one particle instantly affects its entangled partner. This creates a unique gaming and educational experience that demonstrates quantum physics principles while building a sustainable token economy.
